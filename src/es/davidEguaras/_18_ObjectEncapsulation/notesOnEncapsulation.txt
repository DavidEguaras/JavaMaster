Encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP).

It refers to the concept of bundling data (fields/attributes) and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit,
typically a class, while restricting direct access to some of the object's components.

This prevents external code from directly modifying the internal state of the object,
promoting better control over the data and its behavior.


In Java, encapsulation is implemented using:
-Private fields: The class's fields (attributes) are declared as private so they cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.
-Public getter and setter methods: These are used to access and update the values of private fields indirectly,
                                   allowing for controlled access
