In Java, access modifiers are keywords that set the accessibility of classes, methods, and variables. They determine where these elements can be accessed from within a program. The four most common access modifiers in Java are:

--1.PUBLIC
Meaning: The public modifier makes the class, method, or variable accessible from any other class in any package.
Usage: If a method, class, or variable is declared as public, it can be accessed from anywhere in the program.
Example:
public class MyClass {
    public int myVar = 10;

    public void myMethod() {
        System.out.println("Public method");
    }
}
Effect: Other classes, even those in different packages, can access myVar and myMethod.


--2.PRIVATE
Meaning: The private modifier restricts access to the class, method, or variable to within the same class only.
Usage: If a field or method is declared as private, it can only be accessed or modified within the class it is defined in.
Example:
public class MyClass {
    private int myVar = 10;

    private void myMethod() {
        System.out.println("Private method");
    }
}
Effect: myVar and myMethod cannot be accessed from outside MyClass, not even by subclasses.

--3.PROTECTED
Meaning: The protected modifier allows access to the class, method, or variable within the same package and by subclasses (even if they are in different packages).
Usage: This is commonly used when you want to allow subclasses to access fields or methods while keeping them hidden from other non-subclass classes.
Example:
public class MyClass {
    protected int myVar = 10;

    protected void myMethod() {
        System.out.println("Protected method");
    }
}
Effect: Other classes in the same package and subclasses in different packages can access myVar and myMethod, but other unrelated classes cannot.


--4. DEFAULT (NO MODIFIER)
Meaning: When no access modifier is specified, the element is accessible only within its own package. This is sometimes referred to as "package-private" or "default" access.
Usage: This is used when you want to restrict access to other classes within the same package but do not want to make it accessible to subclasses or classes outside the package.
Example:
class MyClass {
    int myVar = 10; // default access

    void myMethod() {
        System.out.println("Default method");
    }
}



Effect: myVar and myMethod are accessible by any class in the same package, but not by classes in different packages.
Summary of Access Levels:

______________________________________________
Modifier	Class	Package	 Subclass	World
public	      Yes	  Yes	   Yes	     Yes
protected	  Yes	  Yes 	   Yes	     No
NO MODIFIER   Yes	  Yes	   No	     No
private	      Yes	   No	   No	     No
______________________________________________

In essence:
public: Accessible from everywhere.
private: Accessible only within the same class.
protected: Accessible within the same package and subclasses.
default (no modifier): Accessible only within the same package.
