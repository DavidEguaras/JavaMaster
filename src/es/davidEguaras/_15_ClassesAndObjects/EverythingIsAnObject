In Java, every class implicitly inherits from the Object class unless it explicitly extends another class.
The Object class is the root of the Java class hierarchy. This means that:
-All Classes Directly or Indirectly Inherit from Object:
-If a class does not explicitly extend another class, it automatically extends Object.
-If a class extends another class, it eventually inherits from Object through the chain of inheritance.

Why Object is the Root of All Classes
-The design of Java ensures that all classes share certain common behaviors and characteristics, which are defined in the Object class.

By having every class inherit from Object, Java guarantees that every object can:
-Be treated as an instance of Object.
-Use the basic methods provided by Object, such as toString(), equals(), and hashCode().
