There should be 3 classes: User, Booking and Car
-Booking implementations:
    A Booking will always have a User and a Car
    The booking class will have a static array, to record all the bookings made
-User implementations:
    Each user has a history (array) of all his bookings (current and previous)
    The User class will have a static array to record all users created
-Car implementations
    Car doesn't implement other classes, it's just a normal car
    The Car class will have a static array to record all cars created
    Each car must have a boolean attribute, to represent availability
