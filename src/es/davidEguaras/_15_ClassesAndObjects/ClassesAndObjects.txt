-Classes are made of properties and behaviors
-We should never have access to the internal properties of our objects (but the methods/behaviors should be public in most cases),
they should be accessed by getters and setters
-If we don't declare a specific constructor, Java gives us one by default
-@Override is mainly for readability, useful for knowing that a method from the parent class is being overwritten/overridden
-POJO (Plain Old Java Object): A simple, lightweight Java object that:
    Does not extend special classes or implement special interfaces.
    Has private fields with public getter/setter methods.
    Has no specific annotations or framework dependencies.
    May have any type of constructor.
    POJOs are used for creating simple objects that encapsulate data and behaviors, and they are flexible, easy to use, and easy to test.

-A JavaBean is a special type of POJO (Plain Old Java Object) that follows specific conventions and is used primarily for encapsulating data in Java applications.
JavaBeans are often used in frameworks (like Java EE or Spring) for handling data and properties in a standardized way.
