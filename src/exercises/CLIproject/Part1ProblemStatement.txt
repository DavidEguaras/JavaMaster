Part 1 - Initial Implementation
As an admin for a car company I would like to have system to book cars and view users.

Develop a car booking cli system.

Display a menu options to the user such as:

1️⃣ - Book Car
2️⃣ - View All User Booked Cars
3️⃣ - View All Bookings
4️⃣ - View Available Cars
5️⃣ - View Available Electric Cars
6️⃣ - View all users
7️⃣ - Exit

When booking a new car your system should ask for:

-the user id. Each user must have unique identifier (id) which must be generated by the system.
-the car to be booked
There is no right or wrong implementation have a think about the functionality and how you want your system to behave.

Think about the POJOs classes you might need such User, Car, Booking etc...

Think about the service classes you might need for business logic...

Make sure to use packages to organize your code.

User the right naming conventions. for classes, methods and packages

danger
IMPORTANT - You must use Arrays to hold any data. Do not use Lists at this point. We will later.

danger
IMPORTANT - Do not use dependency injection just yet. We will later

note
Feel free to have static data already present in your system. In the code snippet bellow UserDao returns 2 users when getUsers() is invoked. You can do the same for Cars. This is not true for bookings though.

package com.amigoscode.user;
import java.util.UUID;
public class UserDao {
    private static final User[] users;
    static {
        users = new User[]{
                new User(UUID.fromString("8ca51d2b-aaaf-4bf2-834a-e02964e10fc3"), "James"),
                new User(UUID.fromString("b10d126a-3608-4980-9f9c-aa179f5cebc3"), "Jamila")
        };
    }
    public User[] getUsers() {
        return users;
    }
}

Generating random ids for users.
You can use integers or use UUID class - https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/UUID.html

You can also use https://www.uuidgenerator.net/version4 to get a random string UUID and to convert it to UUID type use UUID.fromString("8ca51d2b-aaaf-4bf2-834a-e02964e10fc3")
